# Advent-of-Code-2025-shenanigans
I am pretty much a beginner when it comes to coding. Nevertheless I still have fun whenever I challenge myself with AoC. This repository is simply meant to be a place where I store my 2025 progress :D

So, remember: 
1. for me, having fun does not mean being an expert
2. my code can and will be flawed. If you are someone who has more experience than me or simply has ideas, feel free to share them with me!
3. constructive criticism is always appreciated
